*Antimony* is a computer-aided design (CAD) tool from a parallel universe
in which CAD software evolved from Lisp machines rather than drafting tables

*Antimony* is still under active development, and should currently be considered
alpha software.  It is suitable for experimental and non-mission-critical use.

To get started, refer to the [build instructions](https://github.com/mkeeter/antimony/blob/master/BUILDING.md)
or download a [prebuilt Mac application](http://mattkeeter.com/projects/antimony/antimony.tar.gz).

This work is a spiritual successor to [kokopelli](https://github.com/mkeeter/kokopelli)
