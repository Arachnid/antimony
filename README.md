*Antimony* is a computer-aided design (CAD) tool from a parallel universe
in which CAD software evolved from Lisp machines rather than drafting tables

It's not quite ready for public consumption yet, but if you're feeling bold
download it and give it a whirl.
Packaged applications and instructions on compiling will be made available
in time for [How to Make (Almost) Anything](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.14)
(early September, 2014).

This work is a spiritual successor to [kokopelli](https://github.com/mkeeter/kokopelli)
by way of [fabserver](http://kokompe.cba.mit.edu).
