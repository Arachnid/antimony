## About
*Antimony* is a computer-aided design (CAD) tool from a parallel universe
in which CAD software evolved from Lisp machines rather than drafting tables

This work is a spiritual successor to [kokopelli](https://github.com/mkeeter/kokopelli)
by way of [fabserver](http://kokompe.cba.mit.edu).

For more details and screenshots, look at [this writeup](http://mattkeeter.com/projects/antimony).

alpha software.  It is suitable for experimental and non-mission-critical use.

To get started, refer to the [build instructions](https://github.com/mkeeter/antimony/blob/develop/BUILDING.md)
